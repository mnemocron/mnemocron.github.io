I am Simon, a recent MSc graduate in electrical engineering (and information technology).

For some people engineering is just a job that pays the bills. Not for me. It never was.
Engineering has always been a passion that can be both a job and a hobby - with the difference that you can swap your tinkering for a good book if you need a break from problem solving.
This blog serves as a showcase for some of my hobby projects to come. Some projects are awesome, some are borderline low-level and some are just plain silly.

However, my main focus will be in embedded projects using FPGA or other forms of low-level programming.
