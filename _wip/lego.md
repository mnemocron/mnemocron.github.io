When I was in my teens I was told a lot that I won't have time for LEGOs once I am an adult myself.
That turned out to be bolloks. 
In this silly article, I shall walk you throuhg the process of how I design my own LEGO creations (MOCs) and draw some parallels to the daily business of an electronics engineer.

"I am a twelve year old with the budget of a thirty year old"

"Your late twenties are about rediscovering childhood stuff"

There are a few factors that led me back to this hobby, most notably:
- the rise of third party brands both in terms of brick quality and availavility
- having a disposable income
- trains go bing, bong and choo choo

And a little disclaimer ahead of the process: I do not like The LEGO Group(TM) and their practices.
If you are a LEGO fanboi, you may not like some of my takes.

Anyhow, let's get started.

# Picking a Model

And I am specifically talking about trains here. I like trains. So there is plenty of inspiration to choose from.
I usually check briklink to see if anyone else has attempted to build this model before (_Market Research_).
Either case is intersting as I get to build my own train anyway.
For the sake of this article, lets pick my latest creation: the SBB LÃ¶sch- & Rettungszug (LRZ) because I enjoy how it goes "wroom wroom".

This is a design that has been done by several people before. Those creations are either not detailed enough for my taste, or too big (and expensive). The scale at which LEGO trains are built is a personal choice and is usually defined by the width of the model in LEGO studs. It also represents a tradeoff with impacts on specific use-cases.

| Width in studs | Advantages | Disadvantages | 
|:----|:----|:----|
| 6W | - cheap, the standard set by LEGO | - difficult to achieve details |
| 7W | - "sweet spot" | - very challenging to build on an odd number of studs |
| 8W | - highly detailed | - heavy (for electic motors), expensive |

I personally prefer to stay withing 6W to 7W because I want to motorize them and have them run through my entire appartment and because it is a lot cheaper simply for the sheer amount of parts required.

# Designing Stage

Luckily, we live in the digital age with computer aided design. 
So does LEGO. There is a CAD tool called Stud.io made soley to build LEGO sets and create/generate PDF instructions. 
Those PDFs can then be traded for money on platforms like bricklink.
(It is as much of a profitable side hustle as a piece of rebar is a refreshing beverage)

I can therefore design entire worlds without ever touching a plastic brick.
Which is not recommended - as you could also design an entire circuit board in Altium without ever touching a soldering iron.
It makes sense to conclude that the design stage involves both CAD and simulation as well as hands-on experiments.

## Picking Components

Now here is a hot take: the LEGO assortment sucks! There are bricks in special "rare" colors that cost dozenzs of monies buying a single second hand part. The clear solution is to buy from a different manufacturer that sells this part + color for pennies.
A normal thing in engineering but somehow a wild concept among LEGO fanboys.
When I design a set, I do not care about color "rarity" and I confidently mixing LEGO bricks with China bricks in whatever fashion works best (cheapest).











# A final rant 

There is a small 2nd hand LEGO store within 5min walking distance of my appartment.
I have avoided revisiting that store for years. But one rainy Saturday the curiosity got the better of me and I was quickly reminded of why I will never buy anything there. A dusty, old Power Functions battery box + train motor cost north of 100 USD.
And some customers were (jokingly) throwing threats at each other for mentioning that they would occasionally buy CaDa sets ("you traitor!").
