Somewhere at my workplace we have this complex DSP design with many FIR filters and parallel processing taking place.
It is a classic case of _"historical growth"_ where some straight forward (non AXI) bus was implemented.
This can work in single rate systems with a hardcoded sample rate and a downstream sink which eats up all the samples. 
However, the algorithm in question uses asynchronous processing where the input sample rate is lower or equal to the output sample rate.
Inevitably there is **backpressure** involved.
Backpressure describes a condition where a downstream IP is busy and cannot accept any more samples at its input.
Any upstream master is required to pause sending data.
AXIS sees the use of `m_tready` for this purpose.  

How would you design a DSP algorithm, say an FIR filter which supports pausing at any time?
And how do you deal with the other issue of samples being stuck inside the DSP chain while the upstream `s_tvalid` is deaserted.
A straight forward and easy solution to "just make it AXIS compatible" is shown in _Fig. 1_.

**Fig 1:** _Basic DSP processing IP supporting minimal AXIS functionality including backpressure._

The entire DSP chain can be enabled or disabled by both `tready` and `tvalid`.
This results in a correct behaviour for supporting backpressure.
However, if the input stream is non continuous (e.g. only a short burst / pulse / packet) is sent to the input, the last few samples will remain stuck inside the DSP chain.
One cheap workaround would be to keep `s_tvalid` asserted and force `s_tdata` to zero if the downstream systems allow for zero outputs. There is also a proper way to do it as shown in _Fig. 2_.

**Fig 2:** _Extended DSP processing IP which guarantees completion of calculation when upstream Master stops/pauses sending input samples._

Just like in the previous example, this approach propagates the `tvalid` signal along with each beat of `tdata`.
The main difference is that `tready` is now used at each register stage individually to form a valid transaction together with the propagated `tvalid`.
If the upstream master stops sending samples, this DSP block will continue to calculate the already accepted samples to send them downstream.
One challenge with this design is the high fanout of `tready` as it is non-registered.
Adding an [AXIS pipeline register](https://mnemocron.github.io/2023-12-18-AXI-Skidbuffer/) or a skidbuffer at the in and/or output may ease some timing tension - especially if building multiple DSP IPs with this recipe.
